# Knowledge show off

Here you will find a few samples of my code, they represent my current skills and knowledge (posted Jan 2019).

## Vanilla JavaScript

Can be seen at [Moneta - points of sale](https://www.moneta.si/en/points-of-sale)

### Task: show points of sale on Google map

a) Front-end

- Show points on map (total number of 2.800)
- Get and show points only for current viewport, use REST API
- Fetch points on map boundaries change (pan or zoom)
- Implement search and filters
- Show/hide points if search or filters are enabled
- Show point of sales in sidebar, use Show more
- Show single sale point details
- Handle pin icons

See [files](https://github.com/be-codified/knowledge-showoff/tree/master/vanilla-javascript/front-end).

b) Back-end

- Write service which will store points of sales based on geo coordinates
- Use library Geo Redis to index points of sale
- Get all points based on given center coordinates and radius
- Combine output within search/filters and geo location
